Steps to activate and link version control:

Select tools > version control

Do you want to initiate version control for this project?
yes

If you haven't created a project, go ahead and do that first.

We can now access the git functions via the tab in the right upper box. Click the tab to open the pane. Before the initial commit, you need to tell git who you are.

```{bash}
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --list
```

Now we can create our initial commit, and push it to the repo.
In the git pane, check the box to ensure the changes in the file of interest are "staged". Staging allows us to add files prior to the committed change. It allows you to commit the changes in stages and commit as you go, rather than one large batch (unless that's what you want!)

```{bash}
git remote add origin git@github.com:GITHUB_USER_NAME/setup.git
git push -u origin master
```
